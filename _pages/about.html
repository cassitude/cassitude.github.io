  <p> My name is Cassidy All, I'm a third-year student at the University of Colorado Boulder majoring in Applied
    Mathematics, Statistics, and Information Science as well as conducting research on fairness optimization in
    multi-stakeholder recommendation domains. I'm passionate about recommendation systems, predictive modeling, and
    Bayesian methods. I work on cross-disciplinary problems that require creative agility, deep domain knowledge, and
    optimized computational methods.</p>
