    <p> I seek out complex, interesting problems and learn (or create) the best tools to solve them. I'm at home
        building high-performance systems, designing algorithms, and working with data. It's especially exciting when I
        get the opportunity to analyze sparse, high-dimensional data and do statistical analysis with real-world impact.
        In my free time I like to push the limits; think skydiving, cliff juming, scuba diving, and hiking.</p>
