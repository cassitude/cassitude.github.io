title: "Identifying Image Forgeries by Solving a Linear System"
excerpt: "Solved the three-dimensional, time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation for a Hydrogen atom and derived
theoretical wavelengths from the resulting wavefunction. Then, determined the emission spectrum of
Hydrogen experimentally using diffraction grating, the known spectra for Helium/Mercury, and a polynomial interpolant.
